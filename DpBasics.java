Fibonacci series for basic dp explanation

DP basics:

1. Remember previous answers
2. To solve big one think what it would be the reaction  if the problem is small and predict a answer
3. Complexity of brute force will be TC: O(# of recurive call ^ depth) - overlapping subproblems  and for tabulation O( row ^ col) => 
4. Optimize => trading of space to reduce time
5. How to reduce exponential to linear time

Types:
1. All possible answers - Coin change or decode ways
2. min or max out of possiblity - Coin change
